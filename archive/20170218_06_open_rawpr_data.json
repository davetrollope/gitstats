    "body": "This PR basically adds support to change the `session_id` via `request.session_options`. The problem with the current implementation is that if there's a session already loaded and we try to change the `session_id` via `request.session_options[:id] = \"new session id\"`, a new record will be created with a completely different id, however the cookie will still point to the old `session_id`.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` ruby\n# FIRST REQUEST\nsession[:user] = 1 # creates record in the DB assigning random id. E.g. 1010\nrequest.session_options[:id] = '2020'\n```\n\nBefore the end of the request the session is saved in the database with a different ID (E.g. 3030) since the gem couldn't find any session_id == 2020. However, the main problem is that the `session_id` used in the cookie is now set to 2020.\n\nA subsequent request would be sending a cookie with session_id = 2020, resulting in a unexpected state.\n\n`request.session_options[:id] = '2020'` is probably something that we shouldn't do in the middle of the request but it was something I came across in one of the projects that I work and I kinda of spent some time to find out the problem so I think this could be helpful for other developers.\n\n@gigr @sbfaulkner\n",

    "body": "I was recently working on a feature to log all the outbounds requests made by ActiveResource, and I had to write a similar code in a monkey patch to be able to get the actual parameters that ActiveResource is sending to the outbound requests.\r\n\r\nSome GET requests pass the parameters via query params, and those are already logged in by the current implementation of `LogSubscriber`, in other hand, POST requests' parameters are not passed via query params so, this code should show the parameters on an extra info log.\r\n\r\nI think it can be really helpful to add the parameters info to the payload of the `ActiveSupport::Notification` so the LogSubscriber can use it as required.\r\n\r\nThe change to the `ActiveResource::LogSubscriber` is not 100% mandatory, it would be nice to see it included.\r\n\r\nThe `payload[:result]` contains the response body, but I could not found a way to get the actual parameters we send on a POST request from there.",

This way when\nupdating a model, the params specified in `update_except` are not sent\nto the API, and if the `update_except_primary_key` is set, the `id` is\nnot sent in the request's body.\n\nEven though this implementation works, I believe that the naming is not quite right, so I'd love some suggestions about it.\n",

    "body": "This is my first PR to any Rails project, so let me know if I'm overstepping my bounds or if I missed the memo about how all this works.\n\nI am attempting to resolve two bugs in the `has_many` association (one documented, one not).\n\nThe undocumented bug is that if you call a `has_many` association on a new record, it returns the collection parser **for that record's class**. It should probably return the collection parser for the associated class, no?\n\nThe other bug is documented [here](/rails/activeresource/issues/54) and [here](/rails/activeresource/issues/16). In short, the documentation says:\n\n```\n# If the response body does not contain an attribute matching the association name\n# a request sent to the index action under the current resource.\n# For the example above, if the comments are not present the requested path would be:\n# GET /posts/123/comments.xml\n```\n\nBut that does not seem to be the case. In actuality, the behavior generates a URL like:\n\n```\nGET comments.xml?post_id=123\n```\n\nI believe this PR fixes both those bugs. But I will do further testing to be sure.\n",

    "body": "Hi there,\n\nwe have a small problem with ActiveResource::Collection. It's resource_class and original_params are set after collection instantiation so it means we can't use these 2 within initialization of our own collection parser although we need them.\n\nresource_class and original_params are currently set after instantiation but i don't see any reason for it.\n\nI'v made changes that now resource_class and original_params can be passed to `initialize` method and so they are available there. It changes interface of `ActiveResource::Collection#initialize` so could break something but it doesn't change requirements because defaults are provided which then behaves same as current code.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Or whats the reason for current implementation where they are set after intitialization?\n\nThank!\n",

    "body": "This is an alternative to https://github.com/rails/arel/pull/465\r\n\r\nWe experienced this under jruby in production, and it looks like we're not alone:\r\n\r\nrails/rails#26571\r\njruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter#739\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't change behavior, but it does fix the following problem:\r\n\r\n1. [thread 1] dispatches with `dispatch[object.class]` and a `NoMethodError` is raised.\r\n2. [thread 1] now checks `respond_to?(dispatch[object.class])` and returns `false`.\r\n3. [thread 1] begins walking the ancestor tree.\r\n4. [thread 2] dispatches with `dispatch[object.class]` and a `NoMethodError` is raised.\r\n5. [thread 1] finds a super class and swaps it out in the dispatch cache: `dispatch[object.class] = superklass`.\r\n6. [thread 2] now checks `respond_to?(dispatch[object.class])` and returns `true`, because the dispatch cache has changed, and an error is raised 😱 .\r\n\r\nThis PR makes each visit method store the `dispatch[object.class]` into a `dispatch_method` variable to prevent either thread from being impacted by the `dispatch` cached change.\r\n\r\nSo what happens when two threads hit the visit method now? With this change, both threads will walk through the ancestors, find a matching super class, and write it to the dispatch class. When either retries, they'll get the correct info. In other words, they'll both end up updating the `dispatch` cache with the same value. This is much better than an error being raised for one of them.\r\n\r\nTESTING:\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this by adding some random sleeps into the visitor to path like @abrandoned did. Wherever you see `HERE`, it means a `NoMethodError` was raised and we're about to check `respond_to?`. The test starts 20 threads and each thread runs the [dispatch contamination test](https://github.com/rails/arel/blob/208fe3690d840d0ee65b1395a891886e58fd3f4b/test/visitors/test_dispatch_contamination.rb#L12-L19) 10 times.\r\n\r\nBefore: \r\n```\r\n...\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nHEREHERE\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\nFinished in 1.234906s, 1.6196 runs/s, 24.2933 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n  1) Error:\r\navoiding contamination between visitor dispatch tables#test_0002_does not throw NoMethodError when multi-threaded defining \"visit\":\r\nNoMethodError: undefined method `visit_Arel_Nodes_Union' for #<Arel::Visitors::DepthFirst:0x6a8658ff>\r\nDid you mean?  visit_Arel_Nodes_Grouping\r\n               visit_Arel_Nodes_OuterJoin\r\n               visit_Arel_Nodes_Sum\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nthread opened\r\nHERE\r\nHERE\r\nHERE\r\nHEREHERE\r\n\r\nHERE\r\nthread done\r\nthread done\r\nthread done\r\nthread done\r\nthread done\r\nthread done\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: Forgot to link to the test gist: https://gist.github.com/film42/6e43ce2f27d2f91ee4daf011a20e1c0d",

    "body": "This is a followup to #435 \n\nThis strives to alleviate the inconsistencies in the arel interface:\n\n> `select(arel_table[:name])` works but `select(arel_table[:name].lower)` does not.\n> \n> Or `arel_table[:name].asc` works but `arel_table[:name].lower.asc` does not.\n\nMany nodes can be used in places that are not currently characterized by the current `Arel::Node`. This introduces these common nodes in a way that makes it easier for rails to use common shortcut methods like `desc`, `lower` or other common methods.\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT \"users\".\"id\", \"users\".\"name\"\nFROM \"users\"\nORDER BY LOWER(CASE \"users\".\"address\" IS NULL then \"A\" else \"users\".\"address\") DESC\n```\n\n(yes, this is not the sql I would have written, but I was trying to generate sql that I could imagine generating through rails)\n\nThanks again for being so helpful extending rails and `Arel` to the many needs of your users.\n",

This patch ensures the queries become `\"users\".\"id\" IS NULL` and `(\"users\".\"id\" NOT IN (1, 2) AND \"users\".\"id\" IS NOT NULL)`\n\nNote that IN empty array `[]` still generates `1=0` and NOT IN empty array `[]` still generates `1=1`.\n\nI think this also fixes issue #227.\n\n| Method | Argument | Before this patch | After this patch |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| In | `[]` | `1=0` | `1=0` |\n| In | `[nil]` | `\"users\".\"id\" IN (NULL)` | `\"users\".\"id\" IS NULL` |\n| In | `[1, 2, nil]` | `\"users\".\"id\" IN (1, 2, NULL)` | `(\"users\".\"id\" IN (1, 2) OR \"users\".\"id\" IS NULL)` |\n| NotIn | `[]` | `1=1` | `1=1` |\n| NotIn | `[nil]` | `\"users\".\"id\" NOT IN (NULL)` | `\"users\".\"id\" IS NOT NULL` |\n| NotIn | `[1, 2, nil]` | `\"users\".\"id\" NOT IN (1, 2, NULL)` | `(\"users\".\"id\" NOT IN (1, 2) AND \"users\".\"id\" IS NOT NULL)` |\n",

There seems to be a missing argument in the call to ActionView::LookupContext which causes formats of templates to be ignored.\n\nAfter this small change suddenly my digests started updating as I modified partial used by the pdf.\n",
